			<h2>My Music Journey  </h2>
			<p>
				Starting by singing in choirs with my brother and my mom 🎤, I then got initiated to piano which I've been playing now for 11 years 🎹. It lead me to a deep interest in learning guitar which I played for 2 years 🎸. Now, I sing, improvise on the piano and guitar, and never get away from my airpods 🎧! I also got the opportunity to join musicals camps, and studio sessions with other talented musicians. Let's follow my music flow 📣!

			<h2>My Life Travels </h2>
			<p>
				CHINA 🇨🇳 - As I'm Half French Half Chinese, I went to China many times. My family is from Mandchuria, located in the very north of China near Harbin city. I also went to Hainan, a small island at the very south of China, not too far from Vietnam, where my family lives half of the year. Then, I visited several times cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong,...
			</p>
			<p>
				USA 🇺🇸 - In 2021, I went to Lansing, Michigan for an exchange semester program. It was an amazing experience! I learned a lot about myself, and my host country. Moreover, my host mom took me to Chicago & Washington DC. It was a wonderful and fulfilling part of my life. Earlier, my family and I visited North Carolina, and Georgia. And we went on a 3 weeks roadtrip on the West Coast going from Los Angeles to San Francisco, via Las Vegas.

				Here are the next trips I would like to go on: 🇷🇪🇧🇷🇹🇭🇲🇽🇨🇦...
